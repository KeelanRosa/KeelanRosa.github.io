# KeelanRosa.github.io
because if imma be learning how to use github anyway i may as well go all the way and learn how to use the page feature too

## Current works-in-progress:
* [Sortboards](https://github.com/KeelanRosa/sortboards) - drag-and-drop notecard app (Mavo) (done-ish? It was mostly made on a whim to see what Mavo can do, I had no real plans going into this and thus no solid bar for "done, but could add more features" vs "not actually done")
* Bootstrap CSS-recolour website (JavaScript) (done for my purposes, needs some UX work before more general release)
* Demographically Diverse Character Generator - generate fictional characters of varying race/genders/religion/etc (Python) (done for my purposes, needs some UX work + ability to add information for users outside the US)
* Autodidact Troubleshooter - tracking "bugs" ie "i was trying to learn a new thing and messed up" (Python) (current half-finished project)
